        <h2>About the Series</h2>
        <p>
          Season 3 of Stranger Things—the Netflix show brought to you by the
          Duffer Brothers—released on July 4th. We won't spoil exactly what
          dangers the kids (and frankly, the entirety of Hawkins, Indiana) faced
          this year, although suffice to say that a mind flayer (of sorts) rears
          its head. And of course, you can also expect a fair amount of Dungeons
          & Dragons play... or at least attempted, with everything else going
          on! If you've followed the show, you know how D&D plays a major role
          in the lives of these characters. If you played the game yourself back
          in the 1980's, or interested to see what's underway with the game
          today, read on!

          well as seasoned Dungeon & Dragons players to experience the D&D
          adventure Stranger Things character Mike Wheeler has created for his
